HOWTO
=====

To run the gdb server, do (you do not need sudo if you have
set up permissions correctly):
$ make -C build && sudo ./build/st-util 1234 /dev/sg1

Then, in gdb:
(gdb) target remote :1234

Have fun!

Caveats
=======

`continue' GDB command does not work: target does not step at
all or steps with a turtle speed. Looks like there's something
wrong with SCSI requests.
