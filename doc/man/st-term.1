.SH NAME
.PP
st-term - Serial terminal interface for debugging using STLink device
only
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[I]st-term\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Provides a serial terminal that works through the STLink device,
allowing to do the kind of debugging you would do using the UART of the
STM32 device without having to connect a UART-USB serial adapter dongle.
.PP
It works by having a magic number in sram of the MCU within a structure
that serves as IO buffer.
.PP
The required setup consist of some code that establishes the magic
number, buffer structure and helper functions for actual data
transmission between host and MCU.
